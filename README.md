# Amalgam Energy - A Solana-Based DEPIN for Microgrid Energy, Waste, and Water Management

**Amalgam Energy** is a decentralized infrastructure protocol (DEPIN) built on the Solana blockchain, designed to revolutionize microgrid energy management, waste disposal, and water resource allocation. By leveraging DEPIN and decentralized finance (DeFi) principles, Amalgam Energy creates a transparent, efficient, and sustainable ecosystem for communities.

Energy Allocation Program (solana-program\energy-allocation.rs)

This program implements a system for managing energy allocation and distribution using a virtual battery on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to interact with a shared energy pool, allocating, deallocating, depositing, and withdrawing energy.

The program takes inputs in the form of user actions, such as initializing the battery, allocating energy, deallocating energy, depositing energy tokens, and withdrawing energy tokens. These actions are triggered by users interacting with the program through various function calls.

The outputs of this program are changes in the state of the battery and user accounts. These changes are reflected in the blockchain, updating the available energy in the battery, user allocations, and energy balances.

The program achieves its purpose through several key functions:

Initialize: Sets up the battery with a specified capacity.
Allocate: Allows users to reserve a portion of the available energy.
Deallocate: Enables users to release previously allocated energy back to the battery.
Deposit Energy: Lets users add energy tokens to the battery, increasing their energy balance.
Withdraw Energy: Permits users to take out energy tokens from the battery, decreasing their energy balance.
The logic flow involves checking conditions before performing actions, such as ensuring there's enough capacity in the battery for allocation or sufficient balance for withdrawal. The program also handles token transfers when depositing or withdrawing energy, interacting with Solana's token program.

Important data transformations include updating the battery's available energy, modifying user allocations and energy balances, and transferring tokens between accounts. The program uses structs to represent the battery and user accounts, storing and updating their states as transactions occur.

This energy allocation system provides a way for multiple users to share and manage a common energy resource, with built-in checks to prevent overallocation or withdrawal beyond available limits. It demonstrates basic resource management principles in a blockchain context, suitable for applications in energy trading or distribution systems.
